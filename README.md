`chocpkg` is a set of shell scripts for building Chocolate Doom, 
developed by Simon "fraggle" Howard. 

This fork simply allows me to try to build Windows executables 
on Linux via WSL, though this can also be used on any Linux 
distribution. 

To build, just
./chocpkg/chocpkg build chocolate-doom
